# Real Project Integration

## Objective
Generate 70% of a real feature implementation, focusing on medium complexity features that integrate with an existing codebase and have testable outcomes.

## Feature Selection Criteria
- Medium complexity (3-5 files involved)
- Clear business requirements
- Integrates with existing codebase
- Has testable outcomes

## Implementation Process

### 1. Feature Analysis
Analyze the feature requirement for implementation:
- Implementation approach
- Files that need modification
- New files to create
- Database changes required
- API contract changes
- Testing strategy
- Potential risks and mitigation
- Estimated effort breakdown

### 2. Code Generation
For each component:
- Implement the component for the feature
- Ensure integration with the codebase and related files
- Follow codebase patterns and style
- Proper error handling, logging, and input validation
- Include unit tests and documentation

### 3. Integration Testing
- Compile/syntax check
- Verify integration points
- Basic functionality testing

### 4. Quality Review
- Code quality assessment
- Pattern consistency check
- Documentation completeness

## Usage
1. Analyze the feature and plan the implementation.
2. Generate code for each component as per the plan.
3. Perform integration testing.
4. Review code quality and documentation.
